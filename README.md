# Chalmers Defense

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Danilll01/TDA367-OO-Projekt.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/Danilll01/TDA367-OO-Projekt)

Currently just a very simple startup thing with a graphics library added to it. Will be used as a base to hopefully
create a tower defense game based on defending Chalmers from corona viruses that comes along a path to infect Chalmers.
