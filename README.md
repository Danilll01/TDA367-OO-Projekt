# Chalmers Defense

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/Danilll01/TDA367-OO-Projekt.svg?branch=main)](https://app.travis-ci.com/Danilll01/TDA367-OO-Projekt)

Currently just a very simple startup thing with a graphics library added to it. Will be used as a base to hopefully
create a tower defense game based on defending Chalmers from corona viruses that comes along a path to infect Chalmers.

## Known Issues
### Mac OS
* Currently the application does not work properly for Mac OS. The program is able to start and run but a problem occurs regarding the circle around the towers. They appear slightly oval and the positioning is incorrect.
* Changing from fullscreen to window mode on a Mac causes the program to crash. 

Note: Same problems as above can be expected for Linux.

### Scaling
* When exiting the fullscreen mode the text sometimes becomes hard to read because of a scaling issue with libGDX.
